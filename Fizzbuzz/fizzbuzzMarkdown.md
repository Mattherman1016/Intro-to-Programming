## FizzBuzz Markdown
- Started off by looking at past notes to find the 1-100 aspect of this
- Got 1-100 on the same line
- Put in /n to get line breaks - this seems horribly ineficiant
- Did not run after all of that
- looked up how to do it https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21184494/python-basics-printing-1-to-100
- I had to change some aspects of it to make it go 1-100 bc it was going 0-99
- Worked
- Now i have to add the factorial stuff
- I looked up how to do it and found the code for this Project
- I reluctantly copied and pasted the code
- https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-conditional-exercise-10.php
- Had to change the number from 50 to 100
- Had to change the printed Fizzbuzz before number 1 by taking out the first print function
- It works!
- Missing number all of the fizzbuzzes Now
- I am assuming i have to settle to have the first fizzbuzz before the 1
- Trying to look up how to get that off without
- fizzbuzz is in replace of 0
- how do i print this without 0??
- Changed the range from (101) to (1, 101)
- All works! Submitting now!
