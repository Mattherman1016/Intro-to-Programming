- Started off by making a folder for us - i thought i made a new repository but i messed up - i found this out later
- I shared it with my 3 other team mates
- Once we got cookin and we were able to edit the document on our own computer, i added my HTML5 template
- I first created a layout - this included headers, paragraphs, image placeholders and audio placeholders.
- Once everyone was able to have this on their computer, we all started filling in the gaps in my layout
- I added my audio file - in both .ogg and .mp3
- I added the pictures that chris sent

ITS WORTH MENTIONING THAT ALL OF MY CODE THAT I DIDNT WRITE NOW CAME FROM CODE FROM MY PREVIOUS CLASS WHERE I LEARNED HTML

- Added a CSS sheet
- I added my bio
- edited my spelling and capitalization
- Added images -> had to update sizes of the images
- I centered all of the text
- I changed the font in my CSS file to Helvetica
- I added the background image that chris made
- I changed the font sizes
