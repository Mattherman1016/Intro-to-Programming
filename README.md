 Intro To Programming

## Lets Begin
- Computers just take numbers and put them into boxes, doing second grade math to see if the result of the computation is a zero or a one

## How Do You Type an "A"
- The computer does not know what an A is. They only know 0s and 1s. When you type an A, what happens is the computer registers all of the 0s and 1s associated with the push of the A button and renders that in pixels to creat the shape of an A. 

## From Hardware to Software
- From Dell and Gateway to Microsoft and IBM, hardware and software have grown exponentially since the dawn of its creation.
- Selling the ability to create using their proprietary software.
- These softwares mimic and provide basic human necessities and desires. 

## How does Code Become Software
- Programming looks different in different softwares, like Excel and Scratch
- Developers are handed a problem and write code that solves that problem. 
- software then transfers that code into a machine language.
- "Code is an explicit list of instructions, carried out by interconnected logic gates, turning code into something that can be executed - Software"

## What is an Algorithm?
- Algorithms and software are two different things that compliment each other
- Dijkstras algorithm - Find the shortest possible path in a graph
- Programming Language: System for encoding, naming, and organizing algorithms for reuse and application ->
- Described as an algorithm managing system 
- Resembles a map - tells the code how to function


## The Sprint
- Starts with documents - statements about the way users click buttons
- Next is a list of various error messages and it describes a program that has yet to exist
- Wireframe Mockups - sketch looking pictures of how the site is to look
