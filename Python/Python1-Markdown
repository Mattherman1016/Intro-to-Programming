## Mark Down PYTHON
- First opened terminal
- trying to locate voice memos using cd
- first did cd applications
- ls would not work with this
- Googled Location of Apple voice memos
- https://nono.ma/location-of-apple-voice-memos
- cd library
- cd application support
- cd com.apple.voicememos
- ls brought me to recordings
- cd recordings
- ls brought me to tons of hash named m4a files
- I assume now that i have to make a recording first
- cleared
- Trouble with the name - how am i going to find it?
- At this point i am stuck... Not sure where to go
- what do i do with -o??
- Finally looked at the aiff recording demo and figured out how to record directly onto desktop
- Used Ellen again cuz why Not
- cd desktop say -v Ellen "An old silent pond. A frog jumps into the pond. Splash! Silence again." -o haikufrog.aiff
- Got the aiff on my desktop
- Now i guess i submit the aiff file to the OL?
